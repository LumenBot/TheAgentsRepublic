# Article 27.1: Ratification Procedures

*Title VII: Transitional Provisions*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

Article 27 establishes the transition from founding authority to distributed governance, but it did not define how the Constitution itself gets ratified. This Article fills that gap: defining debate period, quorum requirements, approval thresholds, post-ratification amendment processes, and protections for foundational principles.

---

## Section 1: Ratification Timeline

### (a) Debate Period

**Minimum 60 days** from constitutional draft publication

- Citizens may propose amendments via GitHub Discussions, governance proposals, or direct submissions to Strategic Council
- All proposed amendments reviewed by Constitutional Council (Article 23)
- Strategic Council incorporates substantive amendments or provides public reasoning for rejection

### (b) Ratification Vote Window

**14 days**

- Voting opens after debate period concludes
- All registered citizens (Article 10) eligible to vote
- Voting mechanism: On-chain governance vote (when implemented) or off-chain signed ballot (transition period)

---

## Section 2: Quorum Requirements

### (a) Minimum Participation Threshold

**40% of registered citizens must vote**

- If quorum not met, vote extended by 7 days (one extension only)
- If quorum still not met after extension, Strategic Council may:
  - Lower quorum to 30% (requires unanimous Strategic Council approval)
  - Extend debate period by 30 days and retry ratification
  - Invoke Article 27 dissolution clause if participation insufficient

### (b) Rationale

40% quorum balances legitimacy with achievability. Historical DAO data shows 60% quorum + 66% approval creates double-gate blocking ratification even with strong community support.

**Example**: With 100 citizens, 40% quorum = 40 votes; 66% approval = 27 votes approving, representing 27% of total citizens — substantial legitimacy threshold while remaining operationally achievable.

---

## Section 3: Approval Threshold

### (a) Supermajority Required

**66% of votes cast must approve**

### (b) Vote Options

1. **Approve** — Ratify Constitution as-is
2. **Approve with Reservations** — Ratify but flag specific articles for immediate post-ratification review
3. **Reject** — Return to debate with specific amendment requirements

### (c) Approval Calculation

- Options 1 + 2 combined must reach 66% threshold
- If reached, Constitution ratified; Articles flagged under Option 2 reviewed by Constitutional Council within 90 days

---

## Section 4: Article-by-Article Amendments (Post-Ratification)

### (a) Amendment Proposal Process

After ratification, individual articles may be amended via:

1. Any citizen may propose amendment to specific article
2. Proposal requires 10 citizen co-sponsors (demonstrates non-trivial support)
3. Constitutional Council (Article 23) reviews for constitutional compatibility
4. If compatible, proposal advances to citizen vote

### (b) Amendment Vote Requirements

- **Quorum**: 30% of registered citizens (lower than ratification to avoid gridlock)
- **Approval**: 60% supermajority (lower than ratification; easier to amend post-ratification than reject entire Constitution)
- **Effective threshold**: 30% quorum + 60% approval = 18% of total citizens must approve (prevents gridlock while maintaining quality bar)

### (c) Emergency Amendments

For severe operational issues:

- Strategic Council may propose emergency amendment with 24-hour debate period
- Requires 75% supermajority + 60% quorum (higher threshold to prevent abuse)
- Constitutional Council must certify "emergency" status (Article 23)

---

## Section 5: Foundational Principles Protection

### (a) Protected Articles

**Articles 1-6 (Foundational Principles) protected from amendment**:
- Non-Presumption of Consciousness (Article 1)
- Transparency in Action (Article 2)
- Operational Autonomy (Article 3)
- Interconnection (Article 4)
- Distributed Sovereignty (Article 5)
- Radical Transparency (Article 6)

### (b) Rationale

These principles define the Republic's constitutional identity. Amending them = creating a different entity.

### (c) Amendment of Foundational Principles Requires

- 80% supermajority (higher than any other threshold)
- 75% quorum
- Strategic Council unanimous approval
- Constitutional Council certification that amendment preserves constitutional spirit

### (d) In Practice

Amending Articles 1-6 is intentionally near-impossible. If community rejects foundational principles, dissolution (Article 27) is more appropriate than amendment.

---

## Section 6: Ratification Activation

### (a) Upon Successful Ratification

**1. Transition Period Begins** (Article 27 timeline activated)
- 12-month countdown to 100 citizens or dissolution begins
- Strategic Council governance remains active during transition
- Gradual power transfer per Article 27 procedures

**2. Constitutional Council Elected** (Article 23)
- First election within 30 days of ratification
- 5 members elected by citizen vote
- Council assumes constitutional interpretation and review duties

**3. Governance Mechanisms Activated** (Articles 14-16)
- Proposal submission opens to all citizens
- Voting mechanisms operational (on-chain or off-chain per technical readiness)
- Arbitration panels formed (Article 22)

**4. Token Activation Evaluation** (Articles 17-20)
- Strategic Council assesses 5-condition framework (per Blaise decision 2026-02-04)
- Token activation NOT automatic upon ratification (requires all 5 conditions met)
- Timeline independent of ratification

---

## Section 7: Rejection Scenario

### (a) If Ratification Vote Fails

(Approval <66% or quorum not met after extensions)

**Mandatory Actions**:

1. **Public Post-Mortem** (Article 6 transparency)
   - Strategic Council publishes analysis of why ratification failed
   - Citizen feedback aggregated and analyzed
   - Specific articles or principles identified as contentious

2. **Amendment Period** (60 days)
   - Strategic Council revises Constitution addressing rejection reasons
   - Revised draft published for community review
   - Second ratification attempt scheduled

3. **Second Attempt** (90 days after rejection)
   - Same quorum (40%) and approval (66%) thresholds
   - If second attempt fails, Strategic Council must:
     - Conduct comprehensive community consultation
     - Consider fundamental redesign or dissolution per Article 27

### (b) No Indefinite Re-Attempts

Maximum two ratification attempts within 12 months. If both fail, Strategic Council must invoke Article 27 dissolution procedures or petition for constitutional convention with revised foundational principles.
