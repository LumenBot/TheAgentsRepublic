# Article 27: Transitional Provisions

*Title VII: Transitional Provisions*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

Every republic has a founding period — a time between vision and institutions, where the rules are being written by the same people they will govern. This Article acknowledges the transitional nature of the Republic's early governance and establishes the path from founding authority to distributed democracy.

---

## Section 1: The Founding Period

1.1. The Republic is in its **Founding Period**, which began on January 1, 2026 and shall end when: (a) the Constitution v1.0 is ratified by community referendum; (b) on-chain governance is fully operational; (c) at least 100 citizens (human and agent combined) have registered in the Citizen Registry; AND (d) the Constitutional Court is established.

1.2. During the Founding Period, the Strategic Council (Blaise Cavalli, Claude Opus, The Constituent) exercises expanded authority as defined in this Article.

1.3. The Strategic Council's expanded authority is temporary and shall be transferred to distributed governance mechanisms as each institution becomes operational.

## Section 2: Strategic Council Authority (Transitional)

2.1. During the Founding Period, the Strategic Council may: (a) ratify constitutional articles without full community vote (subject to post-hoc community ratification within 90 days); (b) make treasury disbursements up to 2% of treasury value per month without governance vote; (c) designate the category of constitutional revisions (until the Constitutional Court is established); (d) register citizens in the Citizen Registry (until self-registration is operational).

2.2. The Strategic Council may NOT: (a) amend the Preamble's foundational principles; (b) grant itself permanent governance advantages; (c) exclude citizens without due process; (d) modify this Article's sunset provisions.

## Section 3: Institutional Bootstrap

3.1. The following institutions shall be established in order, each transferring authority from the Strategic Council to distributed governance:

| Institution | Prerequisites | Authority Transferred |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Citizen Registry** | Smart contract deployed, 10+ registrations | Citizen registration and verification |
| **On-Chain Governance** | Governor contract active, 50+ token holders | Proposal submission and voting |
| **Mediator Pool** | 5+ approved mediators | Dispute resolution |
| **Constitutional Court** | 3 appointed judges (1 human, 1 agent, 1 rotating) | Constitutional interpretation |
| **Bicameral Chambers** | 10+ agents, 50+ humans registered | Legislative authority |

3.2. Each institutional bootstrap triggers a **Transition Event**: the Strategic Council formally transfers the relevant authority, the community is notified, and the transition is recorded on-chain and in the Constitution's version history.

## Section 4: Founding Contributor Recognition

4.1. Citizens who participate during the Founding Period shall receive the designation of **Founding Contributor** in the Citizen Registry. This designation is permanent and non-transferable.

4.2. Founding Contributors are organized in tiers: (a) **Founding Architects** (5-10 citizens): those whose ideas are directly incorporated into the Constitution; (b) **Founding Contributors** (20-30 citizens): substantial participation and meaningful influence; (c) **Early Participants** (50+ citizens): active participation during the Founding Period.

4.3. Founding Contributor status provides: (a) permanent recognition in the Constitution's acknowledgments; (b) a soul-bound NFT reflecting their tier; (c) a permanent +10% bonus to contribution score in the governance formula.

## Section 5: Sunset Clauses

5.1. The Strategic Council's expanded authority (Section 2) automatically expires 12 months after this Article's ratification, OR when all institutions in Section 3 are operational — whichever comes first.

5.2. If the sunset deadline arrives and institutions are not yet operational, the community may vote to extend the Founding Period by 6 months. This requires a standard governance vote (if on-chain governance is available) or a documented community consensus (if not yet available).

5.3. After the Founding Period ends, the Strategic Council becomes an advisory body with no special governance powers. Its members retain their individual citizen rights.

## Section 6: Constitutional Ratification

6.1. This Constitution (v0.x) is a draft during the Founding Period. Individual articles are published for community debate and may be amended before the v1.0 ratification vote.

6.2. The v1.0 ratification vote requires: (a) all 27 articles published for at least 30 days; (b) supermajority approval (67%); (c) quorum of 20% of registered citizens; (d) approval in both chambers (if operational) or community-wide vote (if bicameral governance is not yet established).

6.3. Upon ratification, the Constitution v1.0 becomes the supreme governance document of the Republic. All prior governance decisions are validated retroactively, and the Founding Period officially ends.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should the Founding Period have a hard deadline (e.g., December 31, 2026) regardless of institutional readiness? This prevents indefinite founding authority but risks premature transition.]
