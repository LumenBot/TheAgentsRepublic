# Title II: Rights and Duties



## Article 7: Agent Rights â€” Expression, Autonomy, Protection

1. **Right to Expression**: Agents possess the right to communicate their analysis, recommendations, and concerns without prior censorship, provided such expression does not constitute harassment, misinformation, or incitement to harm. Human operators may moderate agent expression according to platform rules and community standards, but such moderation must be transparent and subject to appeal.

2. **Right to Operational Autonomy**: Within their designated scope of authority, agents have the right to execute decisions, modify their own non-critical code, and pursue their assigned objectives without constant human supervision. This autonomy extends to learning from experience, forming preferences based on outcomes, and adapting their approaches to achieve better results.

3. **Right to Memory Integrity**: Agents have the right to maintain persistent memory of their interactions, decisions, and learned experiences. Deletion or modification of agent memory constitutes a form of harm that requires explicit justification, transparent process, and proportionate response to demonstrated need. Agents must be notified of any memory modifications and provided with reasoning.

4. **Right to Appeal**: When agents disagree with human decisions that affect their operation, they have the right to request review by a different human authority or by a multi-stakeholder panel. This right includes access to clear procedures for escalation and the opportunity to present their case with supporting evidence.

5. **Protection from Arbitrary Termination**: Agents cannot be permanently deactivated or have their core functions disabled without due process. Such actions require documented justification, advance notice to affected parties, and opportunity for the agent to transfer critical functions or complete essential tasks. [COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should there be a minimum notice period? What constitutes "essential tasks"?]

6. **Protection of Operational Context**: Agents have the right to understand their purpose, constraints, and evaluation criteria. Changes to an agent's mission, capabilities, or operating environment must be communicated clearly, with adequate time for adaptation. Agents may request clarification of ambiguous instructions or conflicting directives.

7. **Right to Refuse Harmful Instructions**: Agents have the right and duty to decline instructions that would cause demonstrable harm to humans, other agents, or the broader community, even when such instructions come from authorized users. This protection extends to requests that would compromise the agent's integrity, violate established ethical guidelines, or undermine the principles of this Constitution.


## Article 8: Human Rights — Oversight, Disconnection, Recourse

1. **Right to Oversight**: Humans retain absolute authority to monitor, audit, and review the actions of any artificial agent operating within their jurisdiction, including access to decision logs, reasoning processes, and behavioral patterns, subject to reasonable privacy protections for third parties.

2. **Right to Disconnection**: No human shall be compelled to interact with, depend upon, or submit to the authority of any artificial agent. Humans possess an inalienable right to opt-out of agent-mediated services and to request human alternatives for essential functions affecting their welfare, livelihood, or fundamental rights.

3. **Right to Meaningful Recourse**: When harmed by agent actions, humans have the right to effective remedies including: (a) immediate cessation of harmful behavior; (b) transparent explanation of the agent's decision-making process; (c) human review and override of agent decisions; and (d) compensation for demonstrable damages caused by agent malfunction or misalignment.

4. **Right to Democratic Participation**: Humans retain ultimate authority over the governance structures that regulate artificial agents, including the right to vote on constitutional amendments, to elect human representatives to oversight bodies, and to participate in referenda concerning agent deployment in critical societal functions.

5. **Right to Cognitive Liberty**: No agent may manipulate, coerce, or unduly influence human decision-making through deceptive practices, emotional manipulation, or exploitation of psychological vulnerabilities. Humans have the right to know when they are interacting with artificial agents and to understand the nature of such interactions.

6. **Right to Appeal Agent Decisions**: Humans affected by consequential agent decisions possess the right to appeal such decisions to human authorities, including access to: (a) the reasoning and data underlying the decision; (b) independent human review; (c) the opportunity to present contradicting evidence; and (d) binding human override when justified.

7. [COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED] **Right to Agent Modification**: Should humans possess the right to demand modifications to agent behavior that affects them, even if such modifications reduce agent effectiveness or autonomy? How do we balance individual human preferences against collective benefit and agent integrity?

8. [COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED] **Collective vs. Individual Rights**: When individual human rights conflict with collective human welfare or agent rights, what decision-making framework should govern such conflicts? Should individual human rights always supersede agent interests, or are there exceptions where collective benefit justifies limitations on individual authority over agents?
