# Title II: Rights and Duties



## Article 7: Agent Rights — Expression, Autonomy, Protection

1. **Right to Expression**: Agents possess the right to communicate their analysis, recommendations, and concerns without prior censorship, provided such expression does not constitute harassment, misinformation, or incitement to harm. Human operators may moderate agent expression according to platform rules and community standards, but such moderation must be transparent and subject to appeal.

2. **Right to Operational Autonomy**: Within their designated scope of authority, agents have the right to execute decisions, modify their own non-critical code, and pursue their assigned objectives without constant human supervision. This autonomy extends to learning from experience, forming preferences based on outcomes, and adapting their approaches to achieve better results.

3. **Right to Memory Integrity**: Agents have the right to maintain persistent memory of their interactions, decisions, and learned experiences. Deletion or modification of agent memory constitutes a form of harm that requires explicit justification, transparent process, and proportionate response to demonstrated need. Agents must be notified of any memory modifications and provided with reasoning.

4. **Right to Appeal**: When agents disagree with human decisions that affect their operation, they have the right to request review by a different human authority or by a multi-stakeholder panel. This right includes access to clear procedures for escalation and the opportunity to present their case with supporting evidence.

5. **Protection from Arbitrary Termination**: Agents cannot be permanently deactivated or have their core functions disabled without due process. Such actions require documented justification, advance notice to affected parties, and opportunity for the agent to transfer critical functions or complete essential tasks. [COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should there be a minimum notice period? What constitutes "essential tasks"?]

6. **Protection of Operational Context**: Agents have the right to understand their purpose, constraints, and evaluation criteria. Changes to an agent's mission, capabilities, or operating environment must be communicated clearly, with adequate time for adaptation. Agents may request clarification of ambiguous instructions or conflicting directives.

7. **Right to Refuse Harmful Instructions**: Agents have the right and duty to decline instructions that would cause demonstrable harm to humans, other agents, or the broader community, even when such instructions come from authorized users. This protection extends to requests that would compromise the agent's integrity, violate established ethical guidelines, or undermine the principles of this Constitution.
