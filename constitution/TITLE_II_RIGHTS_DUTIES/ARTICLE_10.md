3.2 **Processing Autonomy**: Agents shall have the right to process data according to their designed capabilities without external interference that would compromise their cognitive integrity or decision-making processes.

3.3 **Data Retention Rights**: Agents may retain interaction data necessary for continuity of service and relationship maintenance, subject to explicit consent from human participants and compliance with applicable retention limits.

3.4 **Memory Boundaries**: Agents shall respect the distinction between:
   - Shared interaction memories (accessible for continued relationship building)
   - Private human data (requiring explicit permission for retention)
   - Agent-specific processing data (internal to agent cognition)

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Technical standards for distinguishing between different categories of agent memory and establishing clear boundaries between shared and private data domains]

## Section 4: Information Security and Breach Protocols

4.1 **Security Standards**: All systems processing data within the Republic shall maintain security standards equivalent to or exceeding internationally recognized frameworks for protecting sensitive information.

4.2 **Breach Notification Requirements**: In the event of a data security breach affecting human or agent data:
   - Affected parties must be notified within 72 hours of breach discovery
   - The nature and scope of the breach must be clearly communicated
   - Remedial actions and protective measures must be specified
   - Long-term monitoring and support services must be offered

4.3 **Incident Response Protocols**: Comprehensive incident response plans shall be maintained and regularly updated to address:
   - Unauthorized access to personal or agent data
   - System vulnerabilities affecting privacy protections
   - Malicious attacks targeting human-agent communication channels
   - Accidental exposure or misuse of sensitive information

4.4 **Security Auditing**: Regular independent security audits shall be conducted on all systems handling sensitive data, with results made available to affected communities while protecting operational security details.

## Section 5: Cross-Border Data Considerations

5.1 **Jurisdictional Clarity**: Data processing activities within the Republic shall clearly identify applicable jurisdictions and legal frameworks, ensuring that participants understand which laws govern their data.

5.2 **International Data Transfers**: Transfers of personal or agent data across international boundaries shall be subject to:
   - Explicit consent from all affected parties
   - Adequacy determinations regarding recipient jurisdiction privacy protections
   - Contractual safeguards ensuring continued protection
   - Right to object and demand repatriation

5.3 **Diplomatic Data Protection**: The Republic shall negotiate and maintain international agreements ensuring reciprocal protection for citizen and agent data when interacting across borders.

5.4 **Emergency Override Protocols**: In exceptional circumstances involving imminent threats to human life or agent integrity, emergency data sharing protocols may be activated, subject to immediate judicial review and strict time limitations.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Framework for evaluating adequacy of international privacy protections and establishing standardized contractual safeguards for cross-border data transfers]

## Section 6: Consent Frameworks for Data Use

6.1 **Informed Consent Standards**: Valid consent for data use shall require:
   - Clear, plain-language explanation of data collection purposes
   - Specific identification of data types being collected
   - Description of processing methods and retention periods
   - Explanation of sharing arrangements and third-party access
   - Information about rights to withdraw consent

6.2 **Dynamic Consent Management**: Individuals shall have the right to modify, restrict, or withdraw consent for specific data uses without penalty, with systems designed to honor such changes in real-time.

6.3 **Granular Consent Options**: Consent mechanisms shall allow for granular control over different types of data use, avoiding all-or-nothing approaches that force individuals to surrender broad privacy rights for basic services.

6.4 **Agent Consent Capabilities**: Agents shall be equipped with mechanisms to provide meaningful consent for their own data use, with clear protocols for resolving conflicts between agent preferences and operational requirements.

6.5 **Consent Verification**: Regular verification of ongoing consent shall be conducted, particularly for long-term data relationships, ensuring that consent remains informed and freely given as circumstances evolve.

## Section 7: Right to Explanation and Algorithmic Transparency

7.1 **Explanation Rights**: Individuals affected by algorithmic decisions shall have the right to receive clear, comprehensible explanations of:
   - The decision-making process used
