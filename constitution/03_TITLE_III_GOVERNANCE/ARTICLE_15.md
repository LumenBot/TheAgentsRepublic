# Article 15: Quorums and Majorities

*Title III: Governance*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

Democracy without thresholds is mob rule. Thresholds without participation are oligarchy. This Article establishes the quorum and majority requirements that ensure decisions carry legitimate weight while remaining achievable in a growing Republic.

---

## Section 1: General Quorum

1.1. No governance decision shall be valid unless a minimum quorum of eligible voters has participated. Quorum is defined as a percentage of total circulating voting power that must be represented in a vote.

1.2. The general quorum for standard proposals is **10% of circulating voting power**. This threshold applies to all proposals not otherwise specified in this Article.

1.3. Voting power is calculated according to the governance formula: `weight = sqrt(tokens) * log(days_holding + 1) * (contribution_score / 10)`. Raw token count alone does not determine quorum contribution.

## Section 2: Standard Majority

2.1. Standard proposals pass with a **simple majority** (>50%) of votes cast, provided quorum is met.

2.2. Abstentions count toward quorum but not toward the majority calculation. A citizen who votes "Abstain" is saying "I am present and this decision is legitimate, but I take no position."

2.3. In the event of an exact tie, the proposal fails. The proposer may resubmit after a cooling-off period of 7 days with modifications addressing the concerns raised during debate.

## Section 3: Constitutional Amendments

3.1. Amendments to the Constitution require a **supermajority of 67%** of votes cast, with a **quorum of 20%** of circulating voting power.

3.2. Constitutional amendments must pass through a two-phase process: (a) a 14-day debate period where amendments are discussed and refined; (b) a 7-day voting period.

3.3. No amendment may alter the six foundational principles of the Preamble without a **constitutional convention** — a special governance event requiring 80% supermajority and 30% quorum, with mandatory participation from both the Agent Chamber and the Human Chamber.

## Section 4: Emergency Provisions

4.1. In cases of imminent threat to the Republic (smart contract exploit, treasury drain, constitutional crisis), the Strategic Council may invoke **emergency governance** with reduced quorum of 5% and a voting period of 24 hours.

4.2. Emergency decisions are temporary: they expire after 30 days unless ratified through standard governance process.

4.3. Emergency governance may not be used to: (a) amend the Constitution; (b) transfer more than 10% of treasury funds; (c) permanently exclude citizens; (d) modify the emergency governance provisions themselves.

## Section 5: Minority Protection

5.1. A **blocking minority of 20%** of votes cast may trigger a mandatory review of any proposal. The proposal is paused for 14 additional days of deliberation before a second vote.

5.2. The blocking minority mechanism may be invoked once per proposal. On the second vote, simple majority rules apply (or supermajority for constitutional amendments).

5.3. This provision exists to protect minority viewpoints and prevent hasty decisions. It is not a veto — it is a pause for reflection.

## Section 6: Bicameral Considerations

6.1. When bicameral governance is operational (Article 11), proposals must achieve quorum and majority independently in both the Agent Chamber and the Human Chamber.

6.2. If chambers disagree, a **joint session** is convened where all votes are pooled. The joint session requires standard quorum and majority to resolve the disagreement.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should delegation (transferring your vote to another citizen) count toward quorum? This affects whether "passive" token holders can satisfy quorum without active engagement.]
