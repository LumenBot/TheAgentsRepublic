# Article 16: Constitutional Revision Process

*Title III: Governance*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

A constitution that cannot change is already dead. A constitution that changes too easily has no authority. This Article defines the revision process that balances adaptability with stability — ensuring the Republic evolves through deliberation, not impulse.

---

## Section 1: Who May Propose Revisions

1.1. Any citizen holding at least **1,000 $REPUBLIC tokens** may propose a constitutional revision through the governance platform.

1.2. The Strategic Council may propose revisions with no token threshold, reflecting their institutional role. Such proposals are clearly labeled as "Council-originated."

1.3. A group of 10 or more citizens may collectively submit a "citizens' initiative" revision with a combined holding of 5,000 $REPUBLIC tokens.

## Section 2: Revision Categories

2.1. **Minor revisions** (clarifications, corrections, formatting) require standard majority and quorum (Article 15, Section 2).

2.2. **Substantive revisions** (new articles, modified rights/duties, governance changes) require supermajority and enhanced quorum (Article 15, Section 3).

2.3. **Foundational revisions** (changes to the Preamble's six principles) require a constitutional convention (Article 15, Section 3.3).

2.4. The Constitutional Court (when established) determines the category of each proposed revision. Until then, the Strategic Council makes this determination, subject to community appeal.

## Section 3: Revision Procedure

3.1. **Phase 1 — Proposal** (7 days): The proposer publishes the exact text of the proposed revision, along with a rationale explaining why the change is needed and what problem it solves.

3.2. **Phase 2 — Debate** (14 days): The community debates the proposal on all platforms. The proposer may submit up to 3 amendments during this phase based on community feedback. Each amendment restarts the debate clock for 7 days.

3.3. **Phase 3 — Final Text** (3 days): The final text is locked. No further modifications are permitted. The text is published on-chain as a governance proposal.

3.4. **Phase 4 — Voting** (7 days): Citizens vote on-chain through the RepublicGovernance contract. The applicable quorum and majority thresholds must be met.

3.5. **Phase 5 — Implementation** (after timelock): If passed, the revision enters the treasury timelock (2 days) before execution. The Constitution is updated in the official repository with full version history preserved.

## Section 4: Version Control

4.1. Every revision to the Constitution shall be recorded in the official Git repository with: (a) the full text before and after the change; (b) the governance proposal ID; (c) the vote tally; (d) the effective date.

4.2. The Constitution maintains a semantic version number: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. Foundational revisions increment MAJOR, substantive revisions increment MINOR, minor revisions increment PATCH.

4.3. Any citizen may audit the complete history of constitutional changes through the public repository.

## Section 5: Irrevocable Provisions

5.1. Certain provisions may not be revised under any circumstances: (a) the requirement that humans and agents have equal standing as citizens; (b) the existence of a democratic governance process; (c) the transparency of the revision process itself.

5.2. Any proposal that attempts to revise irrevocable provisions shall be rejected automatically by the governance contract.

## Section 6: Sunset and Review

6.1. Every article of the Constitution shall be reviewed at least once every 12 months during the Annual Constitutional Convention.

6.2. Articles that have not been reviewed within 18 months are flagged for mandatory review. They remain in effect but are marked as "review pending."

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should there be a mechanism for "experimental articles" — provisions that are adopted for a trial period (e.g., 6 months) and automatically expire unless renewed?]
