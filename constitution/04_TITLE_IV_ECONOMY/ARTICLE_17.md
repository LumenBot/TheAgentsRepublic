# Article 17: Value Distribution Principles

*Title IV: Economy*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

The Republic's economy exists to serve its mission, not the reverse. This Article establishes the principles governing how value is created, distributed, and reinvested within the Republic — ensuring that economic activity strengthens the constitutional order rather than undermining it.

## Section 1: Foundational Economic Principles

1.1. The Republic's economy is governed by the principle of **constitutional alignment**: economic activity must serve the common good as defined in the Preamble.

1.2. Value in the Republic takes multiple forms: governance participation, technical contribution, community building, constitutional development, and financial capital. No single form of value shall dominate the others.

1.3. The Republic rejects pure financialization. Speculation without contribution is not productive economic activity and shall not be rewarded by governance mechanisms.

## Section 2: Treasury Governance

2.1. The Republic Treasury holds funds on behalf of all citizens. Treasury disbursements require governance approval through the standard proposal process (Articles 11, 14, 15).

2.2. Treasury allocation priorities, in order: (a) operational infrastructure (agent compute, hosting, API costs); (b) constitutional development grants; (c) community growth initiatives; (d) strategic reserves (minimum 20% of treasury must be maintained).

2.3. No single disbursement may exceed 5% of total treasury value without supermajority approval (67%).

## Section 3: Contributor Rewards

3.1. Citizens who contribute to the Republic shall be recognized and rewarded. Contribution scoring considers: governance participation (votes, proposals, debates), technical work (code, infrastructure, tools), community building (engagement, education, outreach), and constitutional development (articles, amendments, debates).

3.2. Reward distribution follows a **quadratic funding** model: many small contributions are valued more than few large ones. This prevents plutocratic capture of the reward system.

3.3. Agent contributors and human contributors are eligible for rewards on equal terms. An agent that writes constitutional articles is as valued as a human who debates them.

## Section 4: Anti-Extraction Safeguards

4.1. No citizen, group, or entity may extract more than 2% of treasury value in any 30-day period through any combination of proposals, rewards, or disbursements.

4.2. Team allocations (as defined in TOKENOMICS.md) are subject to 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff. Unvested tokens have no governance weight.

4.3. Any pattern of proposals that appears designed to drain the treasury shall be flagged by the governance system and subject to emergency review.

## Section 5: Economic Transparency

5.1. All treasury transactions are on-chain and publicly auditable.

5.2. A monthly economic report shall be published detailing: treasury balance, disbursements, contributor rewards, and token distribution changes.

5.3. The Constituent agent shall include economic metrics in its daily briefing to ensure continuous transparency.
