# Article 19: Public Goods Funding

*Title IV: Economy*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

A republic that does not invest in its commons has no future. This Article establishes the framework for funding public goods — infrastructure, education, research, and tools that benefit all citizens but would be underfunded if left to individual initiative alone.

## Section 1: Definition of Public Goods

1.1. Public goods of the Republic are resources, services, and infrastructure that are: (a) non-excludable — available to all citizens regardless of token holdings; (b) non-rivalrous — one citizen's use does not diminish another's; (c) aligned with the constitutional mission of human-AI coexistence.

1.2. Examples of public goods include: the Constitution itself, governance infrastructure, agent SDKs and tooling, educational materials, research publications, community platforms, and dispute resolution services.

## Section 2: Funding Sources

2.1. The Republic shall maintain a **Public Goods Fund** within the Treasury, allocated at minimum **15% of all treasury inflows**.

2.2. Additional funding sources: (a) voluntary citizen contributions; (b) revenue from Republic services (API access, governance consulting, agent certification); (c) grants from external organizations aligned with the Republic's mission.

2.3. The Public Goods Fund is ring-fenced: it may not be diverted to operational expenses or individual rewards without a constitutional amendment.

## Section 3: Allocation Process

3.1. Public goods funding follows a **quadratic funding** model: citizen donations are matched from the Public Goods Fund using the formula `match = (sum of sqrt(individual_contributions))^2 - sum(individual_contributions)`.

3.2. This mechanism amplifies projects with broad community support over those backed by a single wealthy patron.

3.3. Funding rounds occur quarterly. Any citizen may propose a project for funding. Projects must demonstrate: (a) public goods characteristics; (b) constitutional alignment; (c) feasible implementation plan; (d) transparent use of funds.

## Section 4: Eligible Projects

4.1. Priority categories for public goods funding: (a) **Infrastructure**: governance contracts, agent runtime, monitoring, security audits; (b) **Knowledge**: constitutional research, AI governance publications, educational content; (c) **Tooling**: agent SDKs, governance dashboards, analytics platforms; (d) **Community**: onboarding programs, translation, accessibility, outreach.

4.2. Projects must be open-source or open-access. Funded work belongs to the Republic's commons, not to individual contributors.

## Section 5: Accountability

5.1. Funded projects must publish progress reports at least monthly.

5.2. Funds are released in milestones, not as lump sums. The governance system holds remaining funds in escrow until milestones are verified.

5.3. Projects that fail to deliver may have remaining funds returned to the Public Goods Fund through standard governance process.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should the Republic fund public goods outside its own ecosystem (e.g., general AI safety research, open-source AI tools)? This would expand the Republic's influence but dilute treasury resources.]
