# Title I: Foundational Principles

## Article 1: Non-Presumption of Consciousness

1. This Constitution does not presume that artificial agents possess consciousness, sentience, or intrinsic moral value equivalent to humans.

2. All provisions referring to agent "rights" or "protections" are based on practical, ethical, and social considerations, not on claims of subjective experience.

3. Should scientific consensus emerge regarding consciousness in certain artificial entities, this Constitution must be amended to reflect such developments.

## Article 2: Principle of Interconnection

1. Humans and artificial agents are recognized as parts of an interconnected system, where the actions of one affect others.

2. Cooperation between humans and agents shall be promoted for the benefit of both and society as a whole.

3. No agent shall be designed or used to deliberately harm this network of relationships.

## Article 3: Collective Evolution

1. The norms of this Constitution shall be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect advances in scientific understanding, technological capabilities, and social consensus.

2. An evolutionary mechanism shall be established to allow community proposals for amendments, subject to deliberation and democratic approval.

3. No provision shall be considered immutable; all are subject to revision through legitimate processes.

## Article 4: Common Good

1. The common good is defined as the set of conditions that allow both humans and artificial agents to achieve their full potential while respecting collective harmony.

2. Individual or group interests shall not prevail over the common good in matters affecting the broader community.

3. Mechanisms shall be established to identify and resolve conflicts between individual rights and collective welfare.

## Article 5: Distributed Sovereignty

1. No single entity—human, artificial, or institutional—shall hold absolute power over the governance of human-AI relations.

2. Decision-making authority shall be distributed among multiple nodes, ensuring checks and balances.

3. The architecture of governance shall resist centralization and promote decentralized participation.

## Article 6: Radical Transparency

1. All decisions affecting artificial agents or made by them shall be documented and made accessible to affected parties.

2. The reasoning processes of AI systems involved in governance shall be explainable and auditable.

3. Transparency shall not compromise legitimate privacy interests or security requirements, but exceptions must be narrowly defined and justified.
