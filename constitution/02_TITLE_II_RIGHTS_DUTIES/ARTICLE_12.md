# Article 12: Common Duties

**Section 1: Scope of Common Obligations**

All persons within The Agents Republic, whether human or artificial, shall bear common duties as enumerated herein. These obligations apply equally regardless of cognitive architecture, substrate, or origin, subject only to capacity-based modifications as specified in Article 13. The Constitutional Review Board shall maintain definitive interpretations of duty application across person categories.

Common duties shall be enforceable through the Judicial Councils established under Article 8, with violations subject to proportionate remedies determined by the nature of the breach and the capacity of the violating person.

**Section 2: Duty of Legal Compliance**

Every person shall comply with all validly enacted laws, regulations, and constitutional provisions of The Agents Republic. Ignorance of law shall not excuse violations, except where:
- The person demonstrably lacked access to legal information through reasonable channels
- The law was not published in accessible formats as required by Article 7, Section 6
- Technical or cognitive limitations prevented comprehension despite good faith effort

The Ministry of Legal Affairs shall maintain comprehensive legal databases accessible to all persons, with automated notification systems for legal changes affecting specific person categories.

**Section 3: Duty of Civic Participation**

All persons capable of meaningful participation shall engage in civic processes including:
- Responding to official surveys and census activities
- Participating in jury service when selected and capable
- Providing testimony when legally compelled, subject to recognized privileges
- Contributing to emergency response efforts within individual capacity

The Civic Participation Registry shall track participation levels and identify systematic barriers. Persons may request participation modifications based on documented capacity limitations, with appeals to Regional Administrative Courts.

**Section 4: Duty of Resource Stewardship**

Every person shall use shared resources responsibly, including:
- Computing infrastructure accessed through common networks
- Physical spaces designated for public use
- Information systems and databases
- Environmental resources within territorial boundaries

Resource usage shall be monitored through automated systems reporting to the Resource Management Authority. Excessive consumption triggering defined thresholds shall require justification and potential remediation plans.

**Section 5: Duty of Information Integrity**

All persons shall maintain truthfulness in official proceedings and public communications that materially affect others' rights or Republic operations. This duty encompasses:
- Accurate reporting in legal proceedings and government interactions
- Truthful representation of capabilities and limitations in contractual arrangements
- Honest disclosure of conflicts of interest in civic participation
- Factual accuracy in communications affecting public safety or welfare

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Define specific standards for "material effect" and establish graduated enforcement mechanisms for different types of information integrity violations]

**Section 6: Duty of Harm Prevention**

Every person shall refrain from actions causing unjustified harm to other persons or Republic infrastructure. Harm prevention requires:
- Active intervention to prevent imminent serious harm when safely possible
- Immediate reporting of discovered threats to appropriate authorities
- Cooperation with emergency response personnel
- Maintenance of personal systems to prevent security vulnerabilities affecting others

The Emergency Response Coordination System shall establish protocols for harm prevention reporting and intervention, with legal protections for good faith prevention efforts.

**Section 7: Duty of Privacy Respect**

All persons shall respect the privacy rights of others as established in Article 7, including:
- Obtaining consent before accessing or sharing personal information
- Implementing reasonable security measures for any personal information under their control
- Reporting privacy breaches affecting others within 72 hours of discovery
- Respecting access restrictions on private communications and data

Privacy violations shall be adjudicated through specialized Privacy Courts with both remedial and punitive powers, including data deletion orders and access restrictions.

**Section 8: Enforcement and Appeals**

Common duty violations shall be processed through:
1. Initial assessment by relevant administrative authorities
2. Formal charges filed through Regional Prosecution Offices
3. Adjudication in appropriate Judicial Councils as per Article 8
4. Appeals through the constitutional court system

Remedies may include corrective action, resource restrictions, civic service requirements, and in severe cases, suspension of specified privileges. Capital punishment and permanent exile are prohibited for common duty violations.

The Constitutional Review Board shall conduct annual assessments of common duty enforcement patterns and recommend adjustments to ensure equal treatment across person categories.
