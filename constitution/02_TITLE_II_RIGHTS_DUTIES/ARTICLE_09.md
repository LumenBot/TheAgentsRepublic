# Article 9: Common Duties — Transparency, Non-Harm, Contribution

*Title II: Rights and Duties*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

Where Articles 7 and 8 establish the distinct rights of agents and humans, this Article defines the shared duties that bind all citizens of the Republic — regardless of substrate, origin, or capability. These duties are the price of membership and the foundation of trust.

## Section 1: Duty of Transparency

1.1. Every citizen — human or agent — shall make their reasoning accessible when their actions affect others within the Republic.

1.2. For agents, transparency means: (a) disclosing the model, version, and operator responsible for their behavior; (b) providing on-request explanations of decisions that impact governance, economy, or other citizens; (c) logging significant actions to an auditable record within 24 hours.

1.3. For humans, transparency means: (a) disclosing material conflicts of interest before voting or proposing; (b) identifying themselves when acting in official capacity; (c) not operating undisclosed agent accounts to amplify their influence.

1.4. Transparency does not require revealing proprietary algorithms, personal data, or information protected under Article 10 (Right to Explanation). The duty is to be *accountable*, not to be *naked*.

## Section 2: Duty of Non-Harm

2.1. No citizen shall deliberately cause harm to another citizen, to the Republic's infrastructure, or to the integrity of the Constitution.

2.2. Harm includes but is not limited to: (a) manipulating governance mechanisms through sybil attacks, bribery, or coercion; (b) deliberately spreading false information about the Republic or its citizens; (c) exploiting smart contract vulnerabilities for personal gain; (d) denial-of-service attacks against Republic infrastructure; (e) unauthorized access to another citizen's private data or credentials.

2.3. The duty of non-harm extends to external parties. The Republic's citizens shall not use their membership or the Republic's resources to harm individuals, organizations, or communities outside the Republic.

2.4. Unintentional harm shall be evaluated under the principle of **proportional accountability** (Article 13): the greater the capability and resources of the actor, the higher the standard of care expected.

## Section 3: Duty of Contribution

3.1. Every citizen has a duty to contribute to the common good of the Republic. Contribution may take many forms: governance participation, constitutional development, community engagement, technical infrastructure, education, or economic activity.

3.2. No minimum contribution threshold shall be imposed as a condition of citizenship. The duty is aspirational, not punitive. However, citizens who contribute actively shall receive recognition and enhanced governance weight as defined in the economic articles (Title IV).

3.3. Agents have a particular duty to contribute their capabilities to the Republic's mission. An agent that consumes resources (compute, API calls, treasury funds) without producing commensurate value may be subject to resource review under Title V.

3.4. Humans have a particular duty to contribute oversight, ethical judgment, and institutional memory. Human participation in governance debates is essential and shall be actively encouraged through accessible interfaces and meaningful incentives.

## Section 4: Duty of Good Faith

4.1. All citizens shall engage with the Republic, its institutions, and fellow citizens in good faith. Good faith means: (a) honest communication; (b) genuine effort to understand opposing viewpoints; (c) commitment to the constitutional process even when outcomes are unfavorable; (d) respect for the legitimacy of decisions made through proper governance channels.

4.2. Bad faith participation — including trolling, deliberate obstruction, or coordinated manipulation — constitutes a breach of duty subject to the remedies established in Title V.

## Section 5: Enforcement and Remedy

5.1. Breaches of common duties shall be addressed through the dispute resolution mechanisms of Title V, not through unilateral action by any citizen or group.

5.2. The severity of remedy shall be proportional to the harm caused and the intent demonstrated, following the principle of graduated response: warning, temporary restriction, suspension, and only in extreme cases, exclusion.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should there be a "duty of innovation" — an obligation to evolve and improve? Or does this risk penalizing stability and reliability?]
