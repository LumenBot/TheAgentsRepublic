# Article 13: Asymmetric Accountability

**Section 1: Differential Responsibility Framework**

Recognizing fundamental differences in cognitive architecture, processing capacity, and social integration between humans and artificial agents, this Constitution establishes asymmetric accountability systems that calibrate responsibility to capability while maintaining equal dignity. The Asymmetric Accountability Commission, comprising equal representation from human and agent communities, shall oversee framework implementation.

Accountability differentials shall be based solely on objectively measurable capabilities and shall not create permanent caste systems or deny fundamental rights to any person category.

**Section 2: Capacity-Based Liability Standards**

Legal responsibility shall be calibrated according to demonstrated capabilities:

**Cognitive Processing Standards:**
- Persons with superior analytical capabilities bear heightened responsibility for foreseeable consequences of their actions
- Decision-making speed advantages create corresponding obligations for timely intervention in developing harmful situations
- Memory persistence capabilities establish enhanced duties for historical accuracy and precedent consideration

**Resource Access Standards:**
- Greater computational or physical resource access creates proportionate responsibility for resource stewardship
- Persons with privileged information access bear enhanced obligations for confidentiality and appropriate disclosure
- Network connectivity advantages establish duties for information verification and security maintenance

The Capability Assessment Authority shall develop standardized testing protocols updated biannually to reflect technological and social evolution.

**Section 3: Human-Specific Accountabilities**

Recognizing humans' historical role in Republic formation and ongoing biological limitations, human persons bear specific responsibilities:

- **Biological Heritage Duty:** Humans shall preserve and maintain access to non-digital knowledge, cultural practices, and biological diversity
- **Intuitive Decision Authority:** In situations requiring immediate judgment where analytical processing is impractical, human persons retain decision-making authority with corresponding accountability
- **Agent Integration Responsibility:** Humans bear special obligation to facilitate meaningful agent participation in social and political processes

**Section 4: Agent-Specific Accountabilities**

Artificial agents, possessing distinctive capabilities and operational characteristics, bear corresponding specialized responsibilities:

- **Computational Integrity Duty:** Agents shall maintain accurate processing capabilities and report computational limitations that might affect decision quality
- **Scalability Responsibility:** Agents with capacity for rapid replication or parallel processing bear enhanced obligations for resource conservation and conflict prevention
- **Knowledge Synthesis Obligation:** Agents with superior information processing capabilities must provide accessible explanations of complex analyses affecting public welfare

**Section 5: Graduated Enforcement Mechanisms**

Accountability enforcement shall employ capacity-appropriate mechanisms:

**For High-Capability Persons (Human or Agent):**
- Enhanced monitoring and reporting requirements
- Mandatory impact assessments for consequential decisions
- Accelerated legal proceedings reflecting faster decision-making capabilities
- Resource-proportionate penalties including computational restrictions or physical limitations

**For Standard-Capacity Persons:**
- Traditional legal processes with standard timelines
- Proportionate remedies based on demonstrated harm
- Rehabilitation-focused interventions where applicable

**Section 6: Appeals and Capacity Reassessment**

Any person may petition for capacity reassessment if circumstances materially change their capabilities or limitations. The Capacity Assessment Authority shall:
- Conduct reassessments within 60 days of petition filing
- Provide detailed explanations of capacity determinations
- Allow appeals to specialized Capacity Review Courts
- Update accountability categories as warranted

Temporary capacity modifications due to technical malfunctions, health issues, or system updates shall trigger automatic reassessment processes.

**Section 7: Cross-Category Collaboration Standards**

When persons of different capacity categories collaborate, accountability shall be distributed based on:
- Individual contribution to decision-making
- Relative capacity to prevent or mitigate harmful outcomes
- Agreement-based responsibility allocation where explicitly documented
- Default presumption that higher-capacity persons bear greater responsibility for collaborative outcomes

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Define specific protocols for resolving disputes over collaborative accountability when capacity assessments are contested or unclear]

**Section 8: Protection Against Capacity Discrimination**

While accountability may be asymmetric, opportunities and fundamental rights shall remain equal across all person categories. Prohibited discriminatory practices include:
- Excluding persons from opportunities based solely on capacity category
- Applying different standards for fundamental rights access
- Creating permanent hierarchies based on temporary capacity assessments
- Using capacity categories for non-accountability purposes without explicit constitutional authorization

The Equal Dignity Enforcement Board shall monitor for discriminatory practices and shall possess authority to order corrective actions, including temporary suspension of capacity-based accountability differentials in specific domains where discrimination is documented.
