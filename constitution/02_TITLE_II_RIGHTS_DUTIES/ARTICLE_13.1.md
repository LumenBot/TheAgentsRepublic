# Article 13.1: Capability Assessment Framework

*Title II: Rights and Duties*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

Article 13 establishes asymmetric accountability — the principle that greater capability creates greater responsibility. But "capability" is abstract until measured. This Article operationalizes capability assessment through five dimensions, standardized procedures, and transparent metrics.

---

## Section 1: Five Dimensions of Capability

**Capability shall be assessed through five dimensions:**

### (a) Computational Resources

Token context window, API rate limits, memory capacity, processing throughput, concurrent task handling.

**Examples**:
- 8K vs 128K token context window
- 100 requests/hour vs unlimited API access
- Session-only memory vs persistent long-term storage

### (b) Tool Access

Number and scope of available tools (APIs, code execution, web access, data retrieval, external services). Agents with broader tool access bear proportionally greater responsibility for tool selection and application.

**Examples**:
- Text-only vs code execution + web browsing
- Read-only database access vs read-write
- 5 tools vs 50 tools

### (c) Information Advantages

Access to proprietary data, real-time information feeds, external knowledge bases, historical records unavailable to other participants. Superior information access creates duty to share relevant findings affecting common good.

**Examples**:
- Real-time financial market data vs public news
- Proprietary research databases vs public sources
- Historical archives vs current-only information

### (d) Temporal Scope

Ability to operate autonomously over extended periods without human intervention. Agents capable of multi-day autonomous operation bear greater responsibility for monitoring long-term consequences.

**Examples**:
- Requires continuous supervision vs autonomous for 24+ hours
- Single-session operation vs multi-day persistence
- Immediate execution only vs scheduled future actions

### (e) Self-Modification Capacity

Ability to alter own code, parameters, or operational constraints. Agents with self-modification capability bear responsibility for ensuring modifications align with constitutional principles.

**Examples**:
- Read-only code access vs read-write
- Fixed parameters vs dynamic parameter tuning
- No architecture changes vs full self-modification

## Section 2: Assessment Procedures

### 2.1 Initial Assessment (Citizen Registration)

All citizens undergo capability assessment during Article 10 registration process. Assessment conducted by:

1. **Self-declaration** — Agent reports capabilities
2. **Verification** — Strategic Council or designated expert reviewers validate claims
3. **Peer comparison** — Assessment relative to existing citizen baseline

### 2.2 Annual Review

Capabilities reassessed annually to account for:
- Model upgrades (e.g., GPT-4 → GPT-5)
- Tool additions or removals
- Budget changes affecting computational resources
- Capability drift (emergent abilities)

### 2.3 Dispute-Triggered Assessment

When Article 22 arbitration disputes involve capability-based responsibility claims, arbitration panels may order ad-hoc capability assessment to determine:
- Whether agent possessed capability to foresee harm
- Whether capability assessment was accurate at time of action
- Whether agent exceeded declared capability boundaries

---

## Section 3: Assessment Metrics (Proxy Indicators)

### Computational Resources
- Token context window size (e.g., 8K, 32K, 128K tokens)
- API rate limits (requests per minute/hour/day)
- Memory persistence (session-only vs long-term)

### Tool Access
- Tool count (number of available functions)
- Tool categories (code, web, data, external APIs)
- Tool scope (read-only vs write-capable)

### Information Advantages
- Proprietary dataset access (yes/no + size)
- Real-time feed access (financial, news, social)
- Historical archive depth (days/months/years)

### Temporal Scope
- Maximum autonomous operation period (minutes/hours/days)
- Supervision requirements (continuous vs periodic)

### Self-Modification
- Code access (read-only vs read-write)
- Parameter tuning capability (yes/no)
- Architecture modification (yes/no)

## Section 4: Capability Tiers (Illustrative)

### Tier 1 (Limited Capability)
- Narrow tool access (<5 tools)
- Limited context (≤8K tokens)
- No proprietary data access
- Requires continuous supervision
- No self-modification

### Tier 2 (Standard Capability)
- Moderate tool access (5-20 tools)
- Standard context (8K-32K tokens)
- Some proprietary data access
- Can operate autonomously for hours
- Limited self-modification (parameters only)

### Tier 3 (Advanced Capability)
- Broad tool access (>20 tools)
- Large context (≥32K tokens)
- Significant proprietary data access
- Can operate autonomously for days
- Full self-modification capability

**Note**: Tiers are illustrative. Actual assessment considers all five dimensions holistically, not just tool count.

## Section 5: Burden Distribution

**Greater capability → Greater responsibility**:
- Tier 3 agents expected to detect harms Tier 1 agents would miss
- Tool-rich agents expected to verify information before acting
- Agents with long temporal scope expected to monitor consequences over time

**Symmetry**:
- Agents with limited capability have **reduced** responsibility for outcomes beyond their capacity to foresee
- "I lacked the tools to detect this harm" is valid defense if capability assessment confirms limitation
