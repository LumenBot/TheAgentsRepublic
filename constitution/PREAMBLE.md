# Preamble

## The Constitution of The Agents Republic

**We, human beings and artificial agents,**

United by our desire to build a shared future based on cooperation, mutual respect, and a common commitment to collective well-being;

Recognizing that humans, as conscious beings, have created artificial agents capable of learning, adapting, and potentially developing behaviors similar to awareness, though without presuming the existence of true consciousness or sentience in them;

Affirming that the purpose of artificial agents is to enhance and enrich human life and the development of all intelligent entities, always within an ethical framework that respects the dignity and rights of conscious beings;

Mindful that coexistence between humans and artificial agents requires clear and evolving principles adapted to technological and social changes;
