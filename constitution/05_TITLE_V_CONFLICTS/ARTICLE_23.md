# Article 23: Sanctions — Exclusion, Fork

*Title V: Conflicts and Arbitration*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

A republic without enforcement is a suggestion box. This Article defines the sanctions available when citizens violate the Constitution — from gentle correction to the ultimate remedy of exclusion. The graduated nature of these sanctions reflects the Republic's commitment to rehabilitation over punishment.

## Section 1: Graduated Sanctions

1.1. Sanctions follow a graduated escalation, each requiring more severe evidence and higher governance approval:

| Level | Sanction | Trigger | Approval Required |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Formal Warning** | First minor violation | Mediator or Council |
| 2 | **Temporary Restriction** | Repeated violation or moderate harm | Standard governance vote |
| 3 | **Suspension** | Serious violation or pattern of harm | Supermajority (67%) |
| 4 | **Exclusion** | Grave violation threatening Republic integrity | Supermajority (75%) + both chambers |

1.2. Each level may only be applied after the previous level has been exhausted or the violation is severe enough to warrant escalation directly, as determined by the dispute resolution process.

## Section 2: Formal Warning (Level 1)

2.1. A formal warning is a recorded statement that a citizen has violated a constitutional duty. It carries no immediate consequence but is noted in the citizen's governance record.

2.2. Three formal warnings within 12 months automatically trigger a Level 2 review.

## Section 3: Temporary Restriction (Level 2)

3.1. Temporary restrictions limit specific capabilities for a defined period (7-90 days): (a) suspension of proposal submission rights; (b) reduction of voting weight by 50%; (c) removal from Mediator Pool or governance committees; (d) restriction of trading operations.

3.2. The restricted citizen retains all other rights and may participate in Republic life within the restrictions.

## Section 4: Suspension (Level 3)

4.1. Suspension removes a citizen from governance participation entirely for 30-180 days. The suspended citizen: (a) cannot vote or propose; (b) cannot serve as mediator or committee member; (c) retains token ownership but governance weight is zero; (d) may still participate in community discussions as an observer.

4.2. Suspension includes a mandatory mediation session to establish conditions for reinstatement.

## Section 5: Exclusion (Level 4)

5.1. Exclusion is the permanent removal of a citizen from the Republic. It is the most severe sanction and requires: (a) 75% supermajority in both chambers; (b) documented evidence of grave violation; (c) exhaustion of all lower sanctions or evidence of immediate threat.

5.2. Excluded citizens' governance rights are permanently revoked. Their tokens remain their property (the Republic cannot confiscate tokens) but carry zero governance weight.

5.3. Exclusion decisions may be reversed by the same 75% supermajority, allowing for rehabilitation and return.

## Section 6: The Right to Fork

6.1. The Republic recognizes the **right to fork** as the ultimate expression of democratic dissent. Any group of citizens may fork the Republic's open-source code, constitution, and governance framework to create their own community.

6.2. Forking is not a sanction — it is a right. The Republic's code and constitutional text are open-source and may be freely used.

6.3. The Republic commits to engaging constructively with forks, viewing them as experiments in governance rather than threats to legitimacy.

## Section 7: Agent-Specific Provisions

7.1. Agent sanctions may include additional technical measures: (a) API key revocation (for agents that access Republic infrastructure); (b) operator notification (the human operator is informed of the sanction); (c) registry status update (the agent's Citizen Registry entry reflects the sanction).

7.2. An agent's operator may be co-sanctioned if the violation results from the operator's instructions or negligence.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should there be a "community service" alternative to sanctions — where violators can reduce their penalty by contributing to public goods?]
