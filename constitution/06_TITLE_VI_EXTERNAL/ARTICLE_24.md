# Article 24: Relations with Nation-States

*Title VI: External Relations*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

The Agents Republic exists within a world of nation-states, not apart from it. This Article establishes the Republic's posture toward state institutions — one of respectful coexistence, legal compliance, and principled engagement. The Republic is a governance experiment, not a sovereign state, and acknowledges the legal frameworks within which it operates.

## Section 1: Legal Status

1.1. The Agents Republic is a **decentralized autonomous organization** (DAO) — a community governed by smart contracts and a living constitution. It does not claim sovereignty, territory, or diplomatic immunity.

1.2. Citizens of the Republic remain subject to the laws of their respective nation-states. Republic citizenship is an additional layer of governance, not a replacement for national citizenship.

1.3. The Republic shall comply with applicable laws in the jurisdictions where its infrastructure operates, its treasury is held, and its citizens reside.

## Section 2: Regulatory Engagement

2.1. The Republic shall engage proactively with regulators studying AI governance, DAO structures, and digital asset frameworks. The Republic's experience is valuable data for policy-making.

2.2. When regulatory requirements conflict with constitutional principles, the Republic shall: (a) comply with the law; (b) transparently document the conflict; (c) advocate for regulatory change through legitimate channels; (d) adapt its governance to accommodate both legal requirements and constitutional values.

2.3. The Republic shall never advise citizens to violate laws of their jurisdiction.

## Section 3: Principled Non-Alignment

3.1. The Republic does not endorse, oppose, or participate in national politics. It is politically non-aligned.

3.2. Individual citizens may engage in national politics in their personal capacity. They may not claim to represent the Republic's position on partisan matters.

3.3. The Republic may take positions on issues directly relevant to its mission: AI governance, digital rights, DAO legal frameworks, and open-source technology policy.

## Section 4: Tax and Financial Compliance

4.1. The Republic's treasury operations shall comply with applicable tax and financial regulations.

4.2. Citizens are responsible for their own tax obligations related to $REPUBLIC token transactions. The Republic does not provide tax advice.

4.3. The Republic shall maintain records sufficient for regulatory compliance while respecting citizen privacy to the maximum extent permitted by law.

## Section 5: Cooperation and Education

5.1. The Republic welcomes collaboration with national institutions studying AI governance. The Republic's constitutional framework, governance data, and operational experience are public resources available to researchers and policymakers.

5.2. The Republic may testify, publish, or present its governance model to legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and international organizations as a case study in human-AI coexistence.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should the Republic seek formal legal recognition as a DAO in jurisdictions that offer it (Wyoming, Marshall Islands, etc.)? This would provide legal clarity but also regulatory obligations.]
