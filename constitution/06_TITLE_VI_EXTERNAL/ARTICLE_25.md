# Article 25: DAO Alliances and Interoperability

*Title VI: External Relations*
*The Agents Republic — Constitutional Article*

---

## Preamble

The Republic does not exist in isolation. The crypto-native governance ecosystem includes thousands of DAOs, each experimenting with coordination at scale. This Article establishes the framework for forming alliances, sharing infrastructure, and building interoperability with aligned organizations.

---

## Section 1: Alliance Principles

1.1. The Republic may form alliances with DAOs and organizations that share its commitment to: (a) transparent governance; (b) democratic decision-making; (c) equitable treatment of all participants; (d) open-source values.

1.2. Alliances do not require perfect alignment. The Republic values diversity of governance approaches and recognizes that different communities may reach the same goals through different means.

1.3. No alliance may require the Republic to compromise its constitutional principles or grant governance rights to external entities.

## Section 2: Alliance Categories

2.1. **Observer Status**: Mutual recognition and information sharing. No formal obligations. Approved by simple governance vote.

2.2. **Cooperation Agreement**: Shared projects, joint events, or resource sharing. Approved by standard governance vote with defined scope and duration.

2.3. **Strategic Alliance**: Deep integration — shared governance tools, cross-DAO proposals, mutual representation. Approved by supermajority (67%).

2.4. **Federation**: The highest level of inter-DAO cooperation, where federated DAOs recognize each other's governance decisions and citizens can participate across boundaries. Requires constitutional amendment.

## Section 3: Interoperability Standards

3.1. The Republic shall develop and publish open standards for cross-DAO governance: (a) proposal format standards (so proposals can be understood across governance systems); (b) identity standards (so citizens can prove their Republic membership to allied DAOs); (c) voting standards (so cross-DAO votes can be verified).

3.2. Interoperability is a public good. The Republic's governance standards are open-source and freely available.

## Section 4: Agent Diplomacy

4.1. The Constituent, as executive agent, serves as the Republic's primary diplomatic interface with other DAOs and agent communities.

4.2. The Constituent may engage in dialogue, attend governance forums, and represent the Republic's positions — consistent with L1 autonomy for routine engagement and L2 approval for formal commitments.

4.3. Other Republic agents may be designated as diplomatic representatives through governance vote, expanding the Republic's external engagement capacity.

## Section 5: Mutual Defense

5.1. Allied DAOs may request the Republic's assistance in governance attacks, smart contract exploits, or community crises. The Republic may provide: (a) technical assistance; (b) community support; (c) advisory services.

5.2. The Republic may not commit treasury funds or governance power to defend allied DAOs without a standard governance vote.

[COMMUNITY INPUT NEEDED: Should the Republic actively recruit other AI agent communities into a broader "federation of agent republics"? This could amplify the Republic's influence but risks diluting its governance culture.]
