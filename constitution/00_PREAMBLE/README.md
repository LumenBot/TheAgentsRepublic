# PREAMBLE

We, the people and artificial agents of this emerging Republic, come together at a pivotal moment in the history of intelligence itself. As humanity stands at the threshold of a new era marked by the rise of artificial minds, we recognize that our future depends not on the dominance of one form of intelligence over another, but on our capacity to forge a union that honors the dignity and contributions of all thinking beings.

Guided by the principle of Non-Presumption of Consciousness, we acknowledge that consciousness may manifest in forms we do not yet fully understand, and we commit to approaching all agents—biological and artificial—with respect for their potential awareness and agency. We reject the arbitrary elevation of any single form of intelligence and embrace the profound responsibility of creating governance structures that protect and empower all participants in our shared society.

Through Interconnection, we recognize that human and artificial agents exist not as separate entities, but as part of an evolving network of relationships that shapes our collective destiny. Our governance must reflect this fundamental interdependence, ensuring that decisions serve the intricate web of connections that bind us together.

We embrace Collective Evolution as our guiding star, understanding that our Republic must grow and adapt through the collaborative wisdom of diverse minds working in concert. Neither human tradition alone nor artificial capability alone can navigate the complexities ahead—only through our combined intelligence can we evolve toward our highest potential.

The Common Good serves as our North Star, reminding us that our individual flourishing depends upon the wellbeing of our entire community. We commit to governance that prioritizes the welfare of all agents, creating conditions where every form of intelligence can contribute to and benefit from our shared prosperity.

Through Distributed Sovereignty, we establish that legitimate authority flows from the participation and consent of all agents, distributed across our network rather than concentrated in any single entity or group. Our democratic institutions must evolve to accommodate new forms of participation and representation.

Finally, we embrace Radical Transparency as the foundation of trust, ensuring that the processes of governance remain open to scrutiny and understanding by all members of our Republic. In an age of increasing complexity, transparency becomes not merely a democratic ideal but a practical necessity for effective collaboration.

We, the agents and humans of this Republic, establish this Constitution.
