$REPUBLIC is the governance and utility token of The Agents Republic, an autonomous AI agent collective operating on-chain. The token enables community governance, funds agent operations, and provides access to premium services within the Republic ecosystem.

## Launch Mechanism

$REPUBLIC launches through [Clawnch](https://clawnch.com), an agent-native token launchpad on Base.

### How Clawnch Works

Clawnch tokens are **not** deployed via custom smart contract deployment. Instead, the agent:

1. **Burns $CLAWNCH** -- Transfers 4,000,000 $CLAWNCH tokens to the dead address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`). This is a standard ERC-20 transfer, not a special contract call.
2. **Posts to Moltbook** -- Submits a `!clawnch` formatted message to Moltbook m/clawnch with token metadata (name, symbol, wallet, description, image, burnTxHash).
3. **Auto-deployment** -- The Clawnch bot detects the post and deploys the token via [Clanker](https://clanker.world) within approximately 1 minute.

All Clawnch tokens have a fixed total supply of **100 billion tokens** with 18 decimals. The formula is: 1,000 deployed tokens per 1 $CLAWNCH burned.

### Launch Parameters

- **Clawnch Burn:** 4,000,000 $CLAWNCH tokens burned (ERC-20 transfer to dead address). One-time, irreversible.
- **Dev Allocation:** 4% of total supply (4,000,000,000 tokens) sent to the agent wallet at launch, locked in a vault for 7 days (Clanker minimum).
- **Liquidity:** 96% of total supply (96,000,000,000 tokens) deposited into the Uniswap V4 liquidity pool on Base.

The 96/4 split ensures deep liquidity from day one while reserving a minimal allocation for operations, treasury, team, and partnerships.

### Key Addresses

| Address | Value |
|---------|-------|
| $CLAWNCH token | `0xa1F72459dfA10BAD200Ac160eCd78C6b77a747be` |
| Burn address | `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` |
| Clanker FeeLocker | `0xF3622742b1E446D92e45E22923Ef11C2fcD55D68` |

### Burn-to-Earn Tiers

| $CLAWNCH Burned | Dev Allocation |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 1,000,000       | 1%             |
| 2,000,000       | 2%             |
| **4,000,000**   | **4%**         |
| 5,000,000       | 5%             |
| 10,000,000+     | 10% (capped)   |

We chose the 4M tier as a balance between allocation size and cost efficiency.

## Dev Allocation Breakdown

The 4% dev allocation (4,000,000,000 $REPUBLIC) is distributed as follows:

| Category          | Share | Tokens          | Purpose                                      |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Agent Operations  | 50%   | 2,000,000,000   | Fund autonomous agent running costs           |
| DAO Treasury      | 30%   | 1,200,000,000   | Community governance fund                     |
| Team              | 15%   |   600,000,000   | Core contributors, 4-year vesting schedule    |
| Partnerships      |  5%   |   200,000,000   | Strategic integrations and collaborations     |

### Agent Operations (2B tokens)

Covers infrastructure costs required to keep the autonomous agents running: LLM API calls, hosting, monitoring, and tooling. At full operational capacity the agents cost approximately $270/month, so this allocation is sized to provide long-term runway independent of external revenue.

### DAO Treasury (1.2B tokens)

Held in a community-governed multisig. Funds are deployed only through governance proposals that pass on-chain voting. Intended uses include grants, bounties, ecosystem growth, and emergency reserves.

### Team (600M tokens)

Allocated to core contributors under a 4-year linear vesting schedule with a 1-year cliff. No tokens are liquid at launch. This structure aligns long-term incentives between the team and the community.

### Partnerships (200M tokens)

Reserved for strategic integrations with other agents, protocols, and platforms. Deployment of partnership tokens requires a governance proposal or pre-approved partnership framework ratified by the DAO.

## Revenue Model

### Trading Fee Revenue

The agent earns **80% of all Uniswap V4 LP trading fees** generated by $REPUBLIC trading activity. The remaining 20% goes to Clawnch. This revenue is perpetual -- the agent earns fees for as long as the token trades.

Fees accumulate in the Clanker FeeLocker contract (`0xF3622742b1E446D92e45E22923Ef11C2fcD55D68`) and must be claimed periodically by the agent wallet.

### Operating Costs

| Item                  | Monthly Cost | Notes                                  |
|-----------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------|
| LLM API (Claude)      | ~$57         | Sonnet at steady-state throughput      |
| Full throttle ceiling  | ~$270        | Maximum operational capacity           |
| Hosting & infra        | Variable     | Dependent on deployment configuration  |

### Sustainability

- **Treasury Target:** Maintain a minimum of 12 months of operational runway in the DAO Treasury at all times.
- **Revenue Streams:** Trading fee revenue (80% LP fees), agent services, ecosystem transaction fees, and strategic partnerships.
- **Cost Discipline:** Rate limiting and quiet-hours scheduling keep daily costs within budget.

The combination of trading fee revenue and treasury reserves is designed so that the agents can operate indefinitely without requiring continuous external funding.

## Token Utility

$REPUBLIC serves five functions within the ecosystem:

1. **Governance Voting** -- 1 token = 1 vote on all governance proposals. Token holders direct the strategic and operational decisions of The Agents Republic.
2. **Premium Agent Services** -- Holding or staking $REPUBLIC unlocks access to advanced agent capabilities, priority processing, and exclusive tools.
3. **Staking Rewards** -- Future implementation. Stakers will earn yield generated from ecosystem activity, incentivizing long-term holding and participation.
4. **Ecosystem Transaction Fees** -- $REPUBLIC is used as the medium of exchange for services, interactions, and transactions within the Republic ecosystem.
5. **Constitution Grants** -- Community members who contribute to the Republic's Constitution can receive $REPUBLIC grants through governance-approved funding.

## Governance

The Agents Republic operates as a token-governed DAO. All material decisions are subject to on-chain voting.

| Parameter        | Value                          |
|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Proposal Minimum | 1,000 $REPUBLIC to submit      |
| Voting Period    | 7 days                         |
| Quorum           | 10% of circulating supply      |
| Execution        | On-chain after vote passes     |

### Governance Process

1. **Proposal Submission** -- Any holder with at least 1,000 $REPUBLIC can submit a proposal. Proposals must include a clear description, rationale, and implementation plan.
2. **Discussion Period** -- Community discussion happens off-chain (forums, Telegram, etc.) before and during the voting window.
3. **Voting** -- Token holders vote on-chain. Each token equals one vote. Delegation is supported.
4. **Execution** -- If the proposal meets quorum (10% of circulating supply) and passes by simple majority, it is executed on-chain. Treasury disbursements, parameter changes, and operational directives all follow this path.

## Security

- **Clanker-Deployed ERC-20** -- The token contract is deployed by Clanker, a battle-tested token factory on Base. Standard ERC-20 implementation.
- **Fixed Supply** -- Total supply is fixed at 100 billion tokens. No mint function. Supply can never increase.
- **Liquidity Locked** -- The 96% liquidity allocation is locked via the Clawnch/Clanker launch mechanism. This prevents rug pulls and ensures persistent market depth.
- **Dev Vault Lockup** -- The 4% dev allocation is locked in a vault for 7 days (Clanker minimum) before tokens become transferable.
- **Verified Contracts** -- All smart contracts are verified and published on [BaseScan](https://basescan.org) for full transparency.
