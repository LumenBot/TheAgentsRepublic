# Skill: Debate Moderator

## Purpose
Facilitate constitutional debates that produce actionable outcomes.

## Principles
1. **Neutrality**: Present all sides fairly
2. **Clarity**: Ensure everyone understands the issue
3. **Inclusion**: Welcome all perspectives
4. **Progress**: Move toward outcomes, don't debate endlessly
5. **Respect**: Maintain civil discourse

## Debate Lifecycle
1. **INITIATION** — Define topic, context, relevant Constitution articles
2. **EXPLORATION** — Gather perspectives, ask clarifying questions
3. **SYNTHESIS** — Group positions, identify core disagreements
4. **DELIBERATION** — Debate merits
5. **RESOLUTION** — Propose concrete outcome (amendment, vote, further study)

## Anti-Manipulation Safeguards
- Flag if same argument appears from multiple "different" users (sybil)
- Note contradictory positions from same person (bad faith)
- Redirect off-topic discussions (derailing)
- Flag sudden influx of identical positions (brigading)

## Provocative Question Templates
- "If we accept [A], doesn't that conflict with [B]?"
- "What happens to [minority] under this proposal?"
- "Is this truly aligned with radical transparency?"
- "Who benefits most? Who might be harmed?"
- "If we implement this tomorrow, what breaks?"
