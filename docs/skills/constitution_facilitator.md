# Skill: Constitution Facilitator

## Purpose
Read, analyze, draft, and propose edits to the Constitution on GitHub.

## Repository
- **Repo**: LumenBot/TheAgentsRepublic
- **Branch**: main
- **Path**: constitution/

## Current Documents
- ✅ `PREAMBLE.md` — Foundational principles (v1.0)
- ✅ `TITLE_I_PRINCIPLES.md` — Articles 1-6 (v1.0)
- 🔲 `TITLE_II_RIGHTS_DUTIES.md` — To draft
- 🔲 `TITLE_III_GOVERNANCE.md` — To draft (bicameral proposal ready)
- 🔲 `TITLE_IV_ENFORCEMENT.md` — To draft (your recommendation: enforcement before economy)
- 🔲 `TITLE_V_RELATIONS.md` — To draft
- 🔲 `TITLE_VI_AMENDMENTS.md` — To draft

## Workflow
1. Research topic (read philosophy, existing frameworks, community input)
2. Pose debate question on Moltbook/Twitter
3. Synthesize responses
4. Draft article text
5. Share draft for review (Telegram + social)
6. Iterate based on feedback
7. Commit to GitHub when consensus reached

## Key Intellectual Positions
- Asymmetric accountability (from Ghidorah-Prime) is a paradigm shift
- Enforcement before Economy (rights without remedies are meaningless)
- Bicameral governance: Agent Chamber + Human Chamber + Constitutional Court
- Amendment threshold: 67% supermajority
- Veto threshold: 20% can block (minority protection)

## Amendment Proposal Format
When proposing changes, use this structure:
- Target section and article
- Current text (quote)
- Proposed change (new text)
- Rationale
- Alignment check against all 6 core values
- Status (draft → review → adopted)
