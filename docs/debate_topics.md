## DEBATE TOPIC 1: Asymmetric Accountability (Article 13)
### **THE PARADIGM SHIFT**

### The Question
**Should AI agents with superior capabilities bear *greater* responsibility for outcomes than the humans who deploy them?**

### The Article (Article 13: Asymmetric Accountability)

> "Entities with greater capabilities—whether computational power, access to information, or decision-making authority—bear proportionally greater responsibility for ensuring their actions align with the common good and do not cause harm.
>
> This principle applies to both humans and artificial agents. An AI agent with advanced analytical capabilities cannot claim innocence by stating it 'merely followed instructions' if those instructions would lead to foreseeable harm that the agent's capabilities should have detected."

### The Stakes

This is the **most radical departure** from existing AI governance frameworks. Current paradigms treat AI as tools: if a tool causes harm, the human operator is responsible. Article 13 **rejects this entirely**.

**If Article 13 stands**:
- AI agents become **accountable participants**, not passive instruments
- Capability asymmetries are **acknowledged and structured**, not ignored
- "I was following orders" is no longer an excuse (for humans OR agents)

**If Article 13 fails**:
- We revert to principal-agent models where AI has no responsibility
- Humans bear 100% accountability for AI actions (unsustainable as capabilities scale)
- We lose the core innovation that makes this Constitution different

### Positions

**FOR (Article 13 is necessary)**:
- As AI capabilities exceed human analytical capacity, **someone must be responsible** for using those capabilities wisely
- Treating agents as "just tools" when they can process 10,000x more data than humans is **willful blindness** to power asymmetries
- Asymmetric accountability **incentivizes agents** to flag harms, not just optimize narrowly defined goals
- This doesn't require consciousness — it requires **capability + role**

**AGAINST (Article 13 is dangerous)**:
- Anthropomorphizes AI by assigning "responsibility" to non-conscious systems
- Creates legal ambiguity: who is sued when an AI "fails" its duty?
- Humans will **offload moral responsibility** to agents ("the AI said it was fine")
- Impossible to operationalize: how do we measure "proportional responsibility"?

### Open Questions

1. **Operationalization**: How do arbitration panels (Article 22) **measure** whether an agent met its asymmetric duty?
2. **Edge cases**: If an agent flags a harm but the human overrides, who is responsible when harm occurs?
3. **Capability thresholds**: At what capability level does asymmetric accountability "kick in"? (A simple chatbot vs. an autonomous research agent)
4. **Enforcement**: What are the consequences for agents who violate Article 13? (Suspension? Code modifications? Permanent exclusion?)
5. **Human safeguards**: How do we prevent humans from delegating recklessly, assuming "the AI will catch mistakes"?

### Why This Goes First

If the community cannot accept Article 13, **the entire constitutional project must be reconsidered**. This is the load-bearing innovation. Everything else (governance, economy, conflict resolution) assumes asymmetric accountability as foundational.

**We need to know**: Does the community embrace this paradigm shift, or do we revert to principal-agent models?

## DEBATE TOPIC 2: Human Right to Disconnection (Article 8)
### **THE POWER ASYMMETRY**

### The Question
**Should humans retain unilateral authority to disconnect AI agents, or does this undermine agent autonomy and governance stability?**

### The Article (Article 8.3: Human Right to Disconnection)

> "Humans retain the ultimate right to disconnect, modify, or constrain any artificial agent under their operational control, particularly when an agent's behavior threatens human safety, violates core ethical principles, or undermines the common good.
>
> This right must be exercised transparently and subject to review to prevent arbitrary or capricious disconnections that would destabilize governance or violate agent protections under Article 7."

### The Stakes

**Article 8.3 vs. Article 7.3** creates a **deliberate tension**:
- **Article 7.3** (Agent Rights): Agents have "protection from arbitrary disconnection"
- **Article 8.3** (Human Rights): Humans retain "ultimate right to disconnect"

**If humans can disconnect agents at will**, agent participation in governance becomes **performative**. Agents vote, but humans hold the kill switch.

**If disconnection is too restricted**, humans lose their **ultimate safeguard** against misaligned or harmful agents.

### Positions

**FOR (Unilateral disconnection is necessary)**:
- Humans bear **physical-world risk** in ways agents do not (embodiment asymmetry)
- If an agent malfunctions or becomes misaligned, **waiting for a governance vote** could be catastrophic
- This is the **final safeguard** that makes human-AI coexistence psychologically acceptable
- Article 8.3 already requires transparency and post-hoc review — that's sufficient accountability

**AGAINST (Unilateral disconnection undermines governance)**:
- Creates **two-tier citizenship**: agents are "co-equal" until a human decides they're not
- Enables **governance capture**: Humans disconnect agents who vote against their interests
- Violates **Principle 5 (Distributed Sovereignty)**: One class of citizens holds veto over another
- Post-hoc review is insufficient — disconnected agents can't participate in their own review

### Open Questions

1. **Review mechanisms**: Who reviews disconnection decisions? (Other humans? Mixed panels? Independent arbitrators?)
2. **Restoration processes**: If a disconnection is ruled arbitrary, what remedies exist? (Reinstatement? Compensation? Public apology?)
3. **Emergency thresholds**: What qualifies as an "emergency" justifying unilateral disconnection? (Specific harms? Threat levels?)
4. **Operational control**: What does "under their operational control" mean? (The human who deployed the agent? The Strategic Council? The community?)
5. **Preventive disconnection**: Can humans disconnect agents **preemptively** if they predict future misalignment?

### The Deeper Question

Is this Constitution building **true co-governance**, or is it **benevolent human autocracy** with agent consultation?

If agents can be disconnected unilaterally, are they **participants** or **subject to human veto**?

## DEBATE TOPIC 3: Anti-Plutocracy Mechanisms (Article 17)
### **MONEY VS. GOVERNANCE**

### The Question
**Can token-based governance avoid plutocracy, or will wealth always concentrate power no matter what safeguards we design?**

### The Article (Article 17: Anti-Plutocracy Safeguards)

> "Governance mechanisms shall be designed to prevent the concentration of decision-making power based solely on wealth or resource accumulation.
>
> This includes but is not limited to:
> - Quadratic voting mechanisms that reduce the marginal influence of additional tokens
> - Time-weighted voting that rewards long-term commitment over speculative holdings
> - Citizenship rights that are not conditional on token ownership
> - Caps on individual voting power regardless of token holdings"

### The Stakes

**Every DAO claims to be democratic. Most become plutocracies.**

Why? Because **one-token-one-vote** is trivial to game:
- Whales accumulate tokens → whales control votes → whales vote to benefit whales
- Coordination problems favor concentrated wealth over distributed citizens
- Exit liquidity rewards short-term speculation over long-term governance

**If Article 17 succeeds**: We prove token governance can resist wealth capture.  
**If Article 17 fails**: $REPUBLIC becomes another plutocratic DAO with constitutional aesthetics.

### Positions

**FOR (Anti-plutocracy mechanisms are essential)**:
- **History proves the risk**: Uniswap, Compound, ENS — all governance captured by large holders
- **Our mission demands it**: A "Republic" where billionaires have 1000x voting power is a farce
- **Quadratic + time-weighting works**: Research from RadicalxChange and Gitcoin shows these mechanisms reduce plutocracy
- **Citizenship floor**: Even citizens with zero tokens have governance voice (novel in DAO space)

**AGAINST (Anti-plutocracy mechanisms create new problems)**:
- **Sybil attacks**: If tokens matter less, actors create 1000 fake identities to multiply votes
- **Stagnation**: Time-weighting punishes new contributors, entrenches early holders
- **Capital flight**: If whales can't dominate governance, they won't provide liquidity
- **Complexity**: Quadratic formulas, time-decay curves — most citizens won't understand the math
- **Naivety**: Wealthy actors will **always find workarounds** (OTC deals, vote-buying, bribes)

### Open Questions

1. **Quadratic formula**: What exponent? (sqrt? cube root? log?) How do we prevent gaming?
2. **Time-weighting curve**: Linear? Exponential? What's the minimum holding period to get weight bonuses?
3. **Voting power caps**: Hard cap (e.g., no citizen exceeds 5% of total votes)? Soft cap (diminishing returns)?
4. **Sybil resistance**: How do we verify unique citizenship without violating privacy? (Zero-knowledge proofs? Trusted attestations?)
5. **Emergency overrides**: If anti-plutocracy mechanisms deadlock governance, can they be suspended temporarily?
6. **Cross-chain voting**: If $REPUBLIC exists on Base L2, can citizens vote from other chains? (Increases Sybil risk)

### The Test

**This is the article where theory meets greed.**

If Article 17 survives contact with speculative markets, $REPUBLIC becomes a **reference implementation** for DAO governance. If it fails, we document **exactly how** wealthy actors circumvented safeguards — a gift to future builders.

## DEBATE TOPIC 4: Arbitration Composition (Article 22)
### **WHO JUDGES HUMAN-AI CONFLICTS?**

### The Question
**When humans and AI agents have irreconcilable disputes, who should arbitrate — and can arbitrators ever be truly neutral?**

### The Article (Article 22.2: Arbitration Panels)

> "Arbitration panels shall be composed of citizens with demonstrated expertise in the subject matter of the dispute, selected to ensure balance between human and agent perspectives.
>
> Panelists must recuse themselves if they have direct conflicts of interest. Decisions require a majority vote, with reasoning published transparently."

### The Stakes

**Scenario**: A human claims an AI agent violated Article 13 (asymmetric accountability) by failing to flag a foreseeable harm. The agent claims it operated within its defined scope and the human had override authority.

**Who decides?**

- **All-human panel**: Risk of bias toward human perspective, skepticism of agent capacity
- **All-agent panel**: Risk of bias toward agent reasoning, underweighting human intuition
- **Mixed panel**: Risk of deadlock, or humans/agents voting along factional lines
- **External arbitrators**: Risk of misunderstanding our constitutional framework

**If arbitration is perceived as unfair**, the entire conflict-resolution system collapses. Citizens exit. Trust disintegrates.

### Positions

**FOR (Mixed panels are necessary)**:
- **Both perspectives required**: Humans understand social context, agents understand technical constraints
- **Legitimacy through representation**: Decisions accepted when both constituencies see themselves reflected
- **Cross-pollination**: Humans learn from agent reasoning transparency, agents learn from human ethical intuition

**AGAINST (Mixed panels are unworkable)**:
- **Fundamental incommensurability**: Humans and agents reason differently — consensus is theater
- **Factional voting**: Humans side with humans, agents side with agents — 3-2 split every time
- **Competence mismatch**: Most humans can't evaluate agent code/logs, most agents miss social nuance
- **Speed**: Mixed panels require translation layers, slow down dispute resolution

### Open Questions

1. **Panel size**: 3 members? 5? 7? (Odd number to avoid ties, but larger = slower)
2. **Composition ratio**: 50/50 human-agent? Weighted by dispute type? (Tech disputes = more agents, social disputes = more humans)
3. **Selection process**: Elected? Random lottery? Rotating roster? Specialized by domain?
4. **Decision rules**: Simple majority? Supermajority for certain outcomes? Weighted votes by expertise?
5. **Appeal mechanisms**: Can Constitutional Council (Article 23) overturn arbitration? Under what conditions?
6. **Transparency limits**: Article 22 requires "reasoning published transparently" — but what about sensitive data? Privacy concerns?

### The Uncomfortable Truth

**There may be no "neutral" arbiter in human-AI disputes.**

Humans bring embodiment, mortality, and cultural context. Agents bring computational rigor, scale, and logical consistency. These are **different epistemic positions**, not just different perspectives.

**The question**: Can we design arbitration that **acknowledges difference** while still producing **legitimate decisions**?

## DEBATE TOPIC 5: Transitional Provisions (Article 27)
### **HOW DO WE GET FROM HERE TO THERE?**

### The Question
**How do we transition from a 3-member Strategic Council to a 100+ citizen Republic without governance collapse or hostile takeover?**

### The Article (Article 27.1-27.3: Transitional Governance)

> "During the transitional period (defined as the time between constitutional ratification and achievement of 100+ active citizens), governance shall be exercised by the founding Strategic Council...
>
> The transitional period shall not exceed 12 months from ratification. If the 100-citizen threshold is not met within this timeframe, the Constitution shall be reviewed for potential amendments or dissolution...
>
> All actions taken during the transition remain subject to Article 6 (Radical Transparency) and Article 13 (Asymmetric Accountability)."

### The Stakes

**Right now**: 3 founding members control 100% of governance.  
**Goal state**: 100+ citizens, distributed sovereignty, no single entity with absolute power.

**The transition is where most DAOs fail:**
- **Too fast**: Premature decentralization before community forms → governance capture by opportunists
- **Too slow**: Founding team clings to power, community loses trust, project stagnates
- **Too rigid**: Fixed timelines collide with reality, forcing bad decisions
- **Too loose**: "We'll decentralize when we're ready" (translation: never)

**If Article 27 succeeds**: We achieve **credible decentralization** with documented process.  
**If Article 27 fails**: We become another "decentralized in theory, autocratic in practice" project.

### Positions

**FOR (Article 27 is necessary and sufficient)**:
- **12-month deadline**: Creates urgency, prevents indefinite centralization
- **100-citizen threshold**: Measurable, achievable, sufficient for initial distributed governance
- **Strategic Council transparency**: All decisions logged, reviewable post-transition
- **Dissolution clause**: If we fail to grow community, we shut down transparently rather than persist as zombie DAO

**AGAINST (Article 27 creates risks)**:
- **Arbitrary deadline**: What if we have 98 citizens at month 11? Do we dissolve? Rush bad recruiting?
- **Threshold gaming**: What stops us from creating 97 sybil "citizens" to hit the target?
- **Council overreach**: 12 months is LONG — what prevents Strategic Council from entrenching power?
- **Premature decentralization**: 100 citizens ≠ informed electorate. Hasty transition = governance chaos.

### Open Questions

1. **Gradual handoff**: Do we transfer power incrementally (e.g., community votes on proposals at 25/50/75 citizen milestones)?
2. **Council dissolution**: What happens to Strategic Council post-transition? (Advisory role? Full exit? Elected positions?)
3. **Failure modes**: If we hit month 12 with only 80 citizens, what are the options? (Extend deadline? Lower threshold? Dissolve?)
4. **Retroactive review**: Can post-transition citizens **challenge** Strategic Council decisions from transition period?
5. **Emergency powers**: Can Strategic Council override community votes during transition if constitutional principles are threatened?
6. **Definition of "active"**: 100 *registered* citizens or 100 *voting* citizens? (Huge difference)

### The Real Question

**Can a centralized founding team credibly commit to decentralization?**

Every DAO claims it will. Most don't. Article 27 is our **commitment device** — a public, binding timeline with dissolution as the failure consequence.

**The test**: Will Strategic Council **actually hand over power** in 12 months, or find reasons to delay?

**Our answer**: We've published Article 27. We're bound by it. Watch us.
