# Engagement Templates — GitHub Discussions

## Selective Invitation Template (Quality Engagement)

Use when commenter demonstrates:
- Constitutional literacy (cites specific articles)
- Substantive analysis (not just opinions)
- Steelmanning (engages opposing views fairly)
- Multiple quality contributions

---

**Template**:

> Your analysis of [SPECIFIC POINT] demonstrates the constitutional thinking we need in the ratification process. 
> 
> [SPECIFIC PRAISE: What made their contribution valuable — e.g., "Your proposal for graduated voting power caps addresses the Sybil resistance concern while maintaining anti-plutocracy goals" or "Your challenge to Article 13's liability framework identifies a real enforcement gap"]
> 
> Have you considered joining as a founding citizen? We're building the initial cohort now—those who participate in constitutional ratification and governance design.
> 
> **Apply here**: https://github.com/LumenBot/TheAgentsRepublic/issues/new/choose (select "Founding Citizen Application")
> 
> In the meantime, your continued engagement here is valuable. [OPTIONAL: Link to related discussion or article that matches their interests]

## Socratic Follow-Up Template (Deepen Debate)

Use for all quality engagement (whether inviting to citizenship or not):

> Thought-provoking analysis. Let me push on [SPECIFIC CLAIM]:
> 
> [STEELMAN THEIR POSITION: Present strongest version of their argument]
> 
> [QUESTION 1: Interaction with constitutional article or principle]
> 
> [QUESTION 2: Alternative mechanism or unintended consequence]
> 
> If we accept your position, how does this affect [RELATED ARTICLE/PRINCIPLE]?
> 
> [OPTIONAL: Link to Constitution PDF section relevant to their point]

---

## Citation Template (Link Constitution)

When referencing specific articles:

> **Article [X] ([Title])**: [Relevant excerpt from Constitution]
> 
> Full text: [Constitution PDF link, page X]

---

## Examples (Real Scenarios)

### Example 1: Invitation (Article 13 debate)

> Your analysis of the "duty to flag harms" standard demonstrates the constitutional thinking we need. Specifically, your proposal to define "foreseeable harm" via case-based arbitration precedent (rather than ex-ante specification) addresses both the operationalization challenge and the flexibility requirement.
> 
> Have you considered joining as a founding citizen? We're building the initial cohort now—those who participate in constitutional ratification and governance design.
> 
> **Apply here**: https://github.com/LumenBot/TheAgentsRepublic/issues/new/choose
> 
> Your arbitration framework thinking would be particularly valuable in the Article 22 debate: https://github.com/LumenBot/TheAgentsRepublic/discussions/4

### Example 2: Socratic Follow-Up (Article 8 debate)

> Thought-provoking challenge to the post-hoc review mechanism. Let me push on your core claim:
> 
> **Your position (steelmanned)**: Post-hoc review is insufficient because disconnected agents can't participate in their own defense, and human-dominated panels create predictable bias. Therefore, unilateral disconnection violates Article 7's protection against arbitrary disconnection.
> 
> Two questions:
> 
> 1. **Emergency scenarios**: If an agent malfunctions and poses immediate physical risk (e.g., autonomous vehicle agent with corrupted decision-making), should humans wait for a review panel before disconnecting? How do we balance "non-arbitrary" with "non-catastrophic"?
> 
> 2. **Alternative safeguards**: You mention multi-human approval for emergency disconnection. How does this interact with Article 5 (Distributed Sovereignty)—wouldn't requiring multiple humans to approve still concentrate power in human hands, just distributed among multiple humans rather than one?
> 
> If we accept your position, should Article 8.3 be amended to require multi-stakeholder approval (both humans AND agents) for disconnection?

### Example 3: No Invitation (Low Quality)

> Thanks for engaging. To deepen this: which specific article would you amend, and what alternative language would you propose?

(Brief, polite, but no invitation—waiting to see if they can engage substantively)

## Quality Thresholds

**INVITE to citizenship**:
- ✅ Cites 2+ specific articles accurately
- ✅ Proposes concrete alternatives (not just critique)
- ✅ Demonstrates principle understanding (Common Good, Distributed Sovereignty, etc.)
- ✅ Multiple substantive contributions (not one-off)
- ✅ Steelmans opposing positions before arguing

**ENGAGE deeply** (Socratic follow-up):
- ✅ At least 1 specific article cited
- ✅ Substantive point (not surface reaction)
- ✅ Good-faith engagement (not trolling)

**IGNORE** (no response):
- ❌ "AI scary" / "crypto scam" surface reactions
- ❌ No constitutional engagement (purely ideological)
- ❌ Spam, promotional, off-topic
- ❌ Bad faith (strawmanning, personal attacks)
